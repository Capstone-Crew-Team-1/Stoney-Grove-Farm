        The British White is polled (genetically hornless), docile and was a
        dual purpose breed (beef and milk) until 1950. Since then the British
        Whites selection has been for beef production with carry over heavy milk
        production.
      </p>

      <p>
        The American British White cow is of moderate size, 1000 to 1500 pounds.
        Bulls are from 1800 to 2300 pounds. They are smooth polled although an
        occasional "scur" is observed. Both bulls and cows are very docile in
        nature. The cow udders are well set and tight with small black teats.
        Back lines are straight and strong with a slight slope to the tail head.
        The bull's scrotums are well shaped and large in size, a 38-42cm
        circumference in yearling bulls is normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is much confusion in the United States between the White Park
        breed and the British White breed. There are three associations and
        cattle of the same color are accepted by all the associations. The White
        Park is a horned breed and blood typing of the White Park has shown it
        to be very distant in relation to most of the modern breeds of cattle.
        Sources also state that the mature White Park in Britain are, on
        average, 300 pounds heavier than either the British White or the
        American White Park.

          The British White and White Park cattle were listed in the same herd
          book from 1921 to 1946 when a separate herd book was started for each.
          Originally two types, polled and horned, were admitted into the
          society, but since 1948 only polled have been accepted for
          registration. The cattle, as their name implies, are white with,
          normally, black points, nose, muzzle, eyelids, teats and feet. A few
          cattle have all red points, which is acceptable for registration. The
          British White Cattle Association of America (BWCAA) was formed in 1988
          and it joins British White societies of Great Britain and Australia in
          promoting and registering the polled British White cattle of the
          world.
